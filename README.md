# Codename Project-Catnip-Tree (no final name for app yet)

A small and easy-to-use messageboard aimed at children/pre-school classes to post, what they interesting thing they have learned that day.

**Work-in-progress alpha version**

Very very early in development. Still lots of placeholder and temporary solutions.

## Motivation

A friend of mine who is a pre-school teacher had the idea to use a very simple messageboard in class that can run their own server (Raspberry Pi preferred).

So i started a small learning-project with the following goals:

1.  Build my first Fullstack App utilizing the MERN-Stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, NodeJS)
2.  Deepen my knowledge of React and try out Redux.
3.  Learn how to deploy a Fullstack WebApp
4.  Learn about authentification and protected routes
5.  Create a simple to use UI/UX for young children
